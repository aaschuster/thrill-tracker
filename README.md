# Thrill Tracker

This project is for keeping track/recording experiences at theme parks. The idea is to be able to create a detailed history of one's themepark/amusement park visits. This project is still just in the beginning stages of being built but the plan is for it to handle many users and the ride data can be customized/crowd sourced by the user base. This project is the front-end which is built with React and CSS and accesses with Axios. The backend is in a seperate project and is a RESTful API built with Express and Knex.

### Setup

In order to start up the project install with `npm install` and then use `npm run start`. To access the server add the URL as REACT_APP_SERVERURL to a .env file.
