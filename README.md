# Thrill Tracker

This project is for keeping track/recording experiences at theme parks. The idea is to be able to create a detailed history of one's themepark/amusement park visits. This project is still a work in progress and the plan is for it to handle many users and the ride data can be customized/crowd sourced by the user base. It is built as a mobile first app but has some styling so it doesn't look ridiculous on desktop. This project is the front-end which is built with React and CSS and accesses with Axios. The backend is in a seperate project and is a RESTful API built with Express and Knex.

### Setup

In order to start up the project install with `npm install` and then use `npm run start`. To access the server add the URL as REACT_APP_SERVERURL to a .env file.
